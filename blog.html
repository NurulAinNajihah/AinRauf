		<a class="blog-title">Mocha, The Sister's Cat</a>
			<img src="./assests/img 11.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="mochi"><br>
				<p class="article">Mocha was my sister's cat but it felt like my own too since my sister was away for her internship, I have to take care of him and Mochi. Yes they are bothers, happily living rent free in our house and everyone loved them both even tho some of my family members are scared of cats. And so everything was fine for a few months...until Mocha fell sick and got really skinny. The vet said it's only because of a fever but the more we looked into it, i dont think it's only that. But we got too late to figure it out, and the day my sister have to go back to her intern after only 3 days of vacation, he was gone in the morning before my sister got into the car</p><br>

		
		<a class="blog-title">Mochi, My Best Friend</a>
			<img src="./assests/img 19.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="friend"><br>
				<p class="article">Mochi was one of the nicest cat and best friend that I will ever had. He may have been with me only for a short time but my love for him stays forever. The moment I saw his tummy started to be abnormally large...I knew something was up. I bought him to the vet and did an x-ray to him, turns out he had a coronavirus inside him called <strong>Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)</strong> that causing inflamentation. And not long after discovering it, he had gone to a better place but at least I got to hold him close on the last minutes with him in this world</p><br>
		
		
		<a class="blog-title">Covid-19 and Boredness</a>
			<img src="./assests/img 23.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="covid"><br>
				<p class="article">I still remember when we have to go back to our homes from our campus in Perlis UiTM and was happy we got 2 weeks vacation, but now it's been 2 semesters and a half away and now i missed being in our campus. I was lucky at that time because I got a ticket back to home the day before lockdown happens. And there was still some of my friends that stuck at the campus during the first lockdown. It's been almost a year and a half, my mentality is questionable and my boredome is over the roof. send help._.</p><br>
		
		
		<a class="blog-title">My favorite, food</a>
			<img src="./assests/img 30.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="yum"><br>
				<p class="article">I like to eat everything that looks yummy and smell good. Maybe that's why im so chonky. But my most favourite food is potatoes, because with potatoes you can make everything. Example you can make french fries, mash potatoes or boiled it and it fills you up instantly and it goes great with everything. And for my unhealthy favourite food is chocolate. Mostly milky chocolate or white chocolate because its very sweet and eating it is very satisfying to eat, the moment it melt in your mouths is mmmmmmmm</p><br>
		
		
		<a class="blog-title">Traveling Around</a>
			<img src="./assests/img 29.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="place"><br>
				<p class="article">Traveling does not mean you have to go on a flight and see new parts of the world, sometimes a few kilometers from your home is the enough vacation for you either with friends or family.I always been traveling only with my family since me and my friends are far away from each other. Even tho it might be scary at times while traveling but its fun. The worst thing that had happen was getting pick pocketed while traveling in europe. It costs us to lose money and a camera with the pictures in it. Second worst was in Turkey when I was 12, we been given alcohol in the middle of nowhere after riding a hot air balloon, I dont know what to do so I just do what my sister did and dump it in the snow, but of course making sure we are not been seen by anyone else</p><br>


		<a class="blog-title">Arts and Randoms</a>
			<img src="./assests/img 31.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="draw"><br>
				<p class="article">Im not the best at drawing things but I like to practice and try new things. Drawing has been helping me dealing with anxiety and stressed from schools and assignments that I got and sometimes it got caarried too far and it makes me forgets and get distracted from the reality world that I have to live in. It also helps me creates worlds and new dimentions just for the fun of it and it feels like you have all the things that you ever wanted but in a dream state. Usually I did my arts digitally on my laptop using Medibang paint but traditional way is also acceptable</p><br><br>
